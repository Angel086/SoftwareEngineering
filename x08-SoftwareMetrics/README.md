# Software Metrics

Starting next week, we will cover software quality metrics. Each student is responsible for signing up with a partner to prepare a lesson on one particular metric. To sign up, fork this repo and edit this file to add you and your partner's name to the list.

You will be allowed an entire lecture to deliver your lesson, so it may take up to 50 minutes. Your lesson should include some explanation and examples, but it is recommended to organize a hands-on activity to help your classmates learn the material. However, you may not assign any "homework" or graded assignments.

## Quiz

Following all of the presentations, there will be a quiz on Software Metrics that will cover the above, plus the coverage metrics already discussed in class. Your grade for this assignment will depend on how well other students do on *your* section of the quiz. You may provide a 1-page reference sheet to help students complete the quiz -- the reference sheets will be allowed during the quiz. If you want to provide a reference sheet, print out one for each student plus one for the instructor. If you do not have resources to print, you may provide a PDF to the instructor via email at least 24 hours before your scheduled presentation.
