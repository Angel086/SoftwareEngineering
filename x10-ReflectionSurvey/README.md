This survey is part of a research project about the use of free and open source software projects in computing courses.  Your participation in this research is optional.

If you choose to participate, you will receive credit for one quiz for completing this survey. If you choose to participate in the survey, you get 100% credit for an exercise grade. By participating, you are granting consent for the researchers to analyze your responses to this survey as well as those in the preliminary survey from the beginning of the term. Your name on these questionnaires will only be used to match your response in this survey with the preliminary survey. After the surveys are matched, your name will be replaced with a confidential participant number and no personally identifying information will be reported.

If you choose not to participate, you will receive the same 100% exercise credit by sending the instructor an email with a one page (or less) summary of your experience with the software engineering project. If you choose to email a summary instead of participating in the survey, the contents of your email will NOT be included in the research study.

Information from the questionnaire will be used for statistical studies and will not be used in any form that identifies individuals.  Your answers on this questionnaire have no bearing on your grade in any course.
