# Exercise 07: MC/DC

**Modified Condition/Decision Coverage** is a more advanced analysis of code coverage.

Read ["A Practical Tutorial on Modified Condition/Decision Coverage" (Hayhurst, et al)"](https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~saiedian/Teaching/Fa14/814/Lectures/structural-testing-mcdc-tut.pdf) from Section 2.2 through 3.3.

Collaboratively with your classmates, create a "quick guide" in your own words to give an overview of MC/DC. Each person in class should contribute their own thoughts and revisions to the [Wiki page on MC/DC](https://github.com/ChicoState/SoftwareEngineering/wiki/MC-DC).

This exercise is due by end of the day Monday (March 27th).
