# Quiz 01: Version Control
##Demonstrating Git and GitHub collaboration skills

In this practical quiz, your job is to reconcile the changes that have been identified as [issues](https://github.com/kbuffardi/CPPHelloWorld/issues) in the [kbuffardi/CPPHelloWorld repository](https://github.com/kbuffardi/CPPHelloWorld).

You are expected to follow best practices in following the Fork & Pull model for collaboration and in maintaining useful version control.

You *may* use online sources for help. However, if you take any material from any sources other than your own recollection, make sure to cite your source as a comment inside the source code. The comment should say `Example courtesy of` and provide a URL to your reference (or if your reference is a book or other non-online material, cite the author and title of the resource).

Your pull request(s) will be considered your submission for this quiz. Once you are completed, you are dismissed from class.
