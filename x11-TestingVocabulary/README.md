# Exercise 11: Software Testing Vocabulary

We have discussed and practiced unit testing, test-driven development (TDD), and testing metrics in depth. However, there are other important and related topics in testing.

As a team, you will study one other area in software testing to teach the rest of class. Visit the [wiki for Software Testing Vocabulary](https://github.com/ChicoState/SoftwareEngineering/wiki/Software-Testing-Vocabulary) and see which area your team has been assigned. Your team needs to edit the wiki page to include a summary of **what** the term is, **why** we care about it, **examples** of how it applies in a real-life situation, and **sources** you used as references (and helpful links for more information). Along with the edited wiki page, you should prepare to teach a mini 10-minute lesson on it as a team.
