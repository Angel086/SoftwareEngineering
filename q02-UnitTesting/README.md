#Quiz 02: Unit Testing

For this practical quiz, you will implement and test a class by applying what you learned in class to thoroughly unit test to verify your implementation.

This quiz should be done independently without communication with anyone else. You are expected to keep quiet about the assignment and protect your work until otherwise instructed by the professor.
