# Quiz 3: Testing Practical Quiz

You were just hired by **GameTastic**. They outsourced the work to start development of ConnectX, a variation of the board game "Connect Four." However, when they discovered that their outsourced workers were not following Test-Driven Development, they decided to hire new developers including you. They have tasked you to test the code already written and identify any bugs that already exist. Before going any further, they want to be confident in the code.

Use your knowledge of how to write unit tests and assessing the quality of testing to write sufficient tests so the team can be confident that your tests will identify any problems.

* Fork the [ConnectX repo](https://github.com/kbuffardi/ConnectX) into your own GitHub space

* Clone the fork onto your computer. For this test, you should commit changes to your computer locally, but **do not push any of your commits to the fork until instructed to do so by the instructor**. 

* Keep your local repo clean -- only staging and committing the files relevant to the project tests: ConnectXTest.cpp and README.md. Do NOT commit changes to any other files.

* In README.md, put your name and in bullet-list form, note any bugs you discover. Describe the bugs with enough detail that another developer can start fixing them.

* Do not actually fix the bugs, you will only send your bug report to another developer on the team

* Have your work completed and committed locally on your computer (and ready to push, but not yet pushed) by **Friday morning at 10 AM**

Your grade will be based on the following rubric:

* **50%** Unit tests are written correctly and logically
* **30%** Testing thoroughly assesses the code
* **10%** At least one bug in the code is discovered
* **10%** Instructions followed precisely
* **EXTRA CREDIT**: Bugs are described clearly
