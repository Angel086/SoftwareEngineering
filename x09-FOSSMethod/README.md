# Exercise 09: FOSS Software Development Method

In your small groups, discuss how traditional software development methods apply to working on Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Take into consideration that with FOSS, developers are often volunteers who contribute in their spare time; there usually are not invested business people and "customers" (end users) will not be paying for the software itself; and most collaboration is done remotely with collaborators distributed all around the world.

In your team, formulate a model for how you believe FOSS should be developed with regards to the software development life cycle. In a markdown (.md) formatted text file, write a general overview of your FOSS Software Development Method including a description of the process and philosophies of your method. Come up with a unique name for your method and name the file after the name of your method. In your file, list your names as well as the overview of your method and be prepared to explain it to the rest of the class.

When you are done editing your file, create a pull request to add your markdown file to this repo.
