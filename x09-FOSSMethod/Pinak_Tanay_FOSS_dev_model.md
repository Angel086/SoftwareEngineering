Tanpak's FOSS DEVELOPMENT MODEL   

This FOSS development model is based on iterative and spiral model. However development and testing occurs at the same time for FOSS.

Timeline is decided for each phase.
1) Requirement Phase:  
Group of core developers decides on the structure of the application.
They provide a road map or list of the functionality of the application
They set a requirement page where they list the basic requirements.

2) Design Phase:   
Design for the application is discussed.
Other developers around the world give their inputs on the designing.

3) Development Phase:   
once the basic design phase is over, developers start working on the requirements.

4) Test Phase:   
Automated test programs can be created or core developers can test the code that has made pull request. After testing is done, code is merged.

5) Release:   
All requirements are complete, final product is released.
 
Again the process starts from the beginning to list out requirements for the new version.  

Philosophies   

1.Freedom to work on  

Developers have choice to work on any specific area they want to.   
2.Time Saving   

When the basic source code is available in public,development and testing time is significantly reduced
as 50 developers working in FOSS is time saving then 10 developers working on the same code in a company.  
3.Better Quality Assurance    

As the software evolves many bugs are reported and thereby fixed by the developers.  
4.Reduced costs    

development and testing cost of software products is significantly reduced.
