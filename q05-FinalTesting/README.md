# Quiz 5: Final Exam - GoalUndo Testing

## Overview

Your job is to test the GoalUndo class thoroughly so that developers can verify that it is working correctly and have regression tests for when the code is changed during maintenance. That means that your job is not only to verify that the current solution code is working, but that *any* implementation of the existing functions work as described in the documentation.

## Instructions

* Fork the [GoalUndo repo](https://github.com/ChicoState/GoalUndo) into your own GitHub space
* Clone your fork onto your own computer
* Set the upstream remote in case you the instructor needs to give you changes to the code during the exam
* Working within a branch, add unit tests that thoroughly test the functionality as described in the documentation
* Use your judgment -- based on what you learned over the semester -- to decide when you have written sufficient tests to be confident that any correct implementation will pass your tests and that any incorrect implementation will fail.
* Once you are done testing, push your changes into your fork (keeping it in your branch)
* Submit on Blackboard with the url (beginning with https:// and ending with .git) of the *branch on your fork with your tests*
* Make sure you have *only* pushed changes to the GoalUndoTest.cpp file. No other files should be changed on your GitHub fork.
* Submit before the *end* of the assigned finals session. No late submissions will be considered. No commits to your fork after the deadline will be considered.

## Grading Rubric
* **10%** did you follow the instructions accurately?
* **20%** did you demonstrate recommended practices with git and GitHub?
* **20%** were unit tests written and formatted following recommended practices?
* **30%** how thoroughly did you test the existing code?
* **20%** do your tests verify that each function acts as documented as regression tests?

Questions should be emailed to the instructor and will be answered in a timely manner, but at reasonable hours (less often early in the morning and during the weekend)
